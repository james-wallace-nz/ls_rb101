# Locate the ruby documentation for methods File::path and File#path. How are they different?

## File::path

path(path) → string
Returns the string representation of the path

File.path("/dev/null")          #=> "/dev/null"
File.path(Pathname.new("/tmp")) #=> "/tmp"


## File#path

path → filename
to_path → filename
Returns the pathname used to create file as a string. Does not normalize the name.

The pathname may not point to the file corresponding to file. For instance, the pathname becomes void when the file has been moved or deleted.

This method raises IOError for a file created using File::Constants::TMPFILE because they don't have a pathname.

File.new("testfile").path               #=> "testfile"
File.new("/tmp/../tmp/xxx", "w").path   #=> "/tmp/../tmp/xxx"

## Difference

::path returns the string representation of a path while #path returns a path used to create a string. 

File::path is called on the class with path as its argument.
File#path is called on an opject of the File class
