# Every named entity in Ruby has an object_id. This is a unique identifier for that object.

# It is often the case that two different things "look the same", but they can be different objects. The "under the hood" object referred to by a particular named-variable can change depending on what is done to that named-variable.

# In other words, in Ruby, all values are objects...but they are not always the same object.

# Predict how the values and object ids will change throughout the flow of the code below:
